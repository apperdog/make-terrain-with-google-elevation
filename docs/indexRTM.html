Real terrain maker is an easy tool for creating terrain with the real geographic data. <br />
Specifies the geographic coordinates, and make a terrain of anywhere on the earth in a few clicks. <br />
<font  color="#ffccff">This plug-in runs depending on the Google/Bing/mapbox map service, which requires Elevations API and Static map API keys.</font> <br />

 RTM can generate objects with HDRP/LWRP materials as default.<br >
A Default Shader setting panel shows at the bottom of RTM setting window in Unity 2018.1(and newer).<br >

 <h3>◆Real Elevation data: </h3>
   Using the elevation data of Google map, Bing map, and Mapbox, over 30 meters in most of the Earth areas. When you meet problems such as lack of data in a certain area, try another data source if one is not so satisfactory.<br />

 <h3>◆Easy Setting:</h3>
   <p>To make a terrain faster or in high quality, simulate the real world or make an extravagant land. All setting can be made in a few clicks. Your keys and settings will be saved, no need to remember the location you generated last night.<br />
     
 <h3>◆Save in Many Types: </h3>
   
   The data downloaded can be saved in mesh, terrain, and prefab. The material is created automaticity. You can share the terrain you made with others without a hitch. With a combine and save tool, You can combine and save the generated mesh to prefab and unity terrain at any time.<br />

 <h3>◆Basic Materials for Terrain Provided: </h3>
     Several materials such as contour, grid, gradient and multiple texture height shader. It's possible to add some snow at the top of mountains and lava in the valley.<br />

 <h3>◆ Height Map: </h3>
     A heightmap file will be saved after the terrain generated(optional). You can generate a new terrain with the premade height map at any time.<br />
 
 <h3>◆Style Setting: </h3>
     You can generate a terrain of low-poly style and set a default material before generating them. You can also set the default layer for the use of Infinite Map.<br />

 <h3>◆ Map Style: </h3>
     Besides satellite, many other styles of terrain texture are supported. It is convenient for making a 3D map. Image saved in a folder for each time the generate starts(optional).<br />

 <h3>◆ Preset Template: </h3>
     Include some common options for fast data preview or high details terrain creating. <br />

 <h3>◆ Random Map: </h3>
     One selectable option to generate a random map is provided. It can be used to save time when doing tests or just make an infinite random terrain in a game.<br />

 <h3>◆Run Time Infinite Map: </h3>
     Download the map texture and elevation data automaticity while running the game. The adjacent tiles will be generated while the character moving.<br />

 <h3>◆ Diagnosis Tool: </h3>
     Check the network condition and API key state. If you are not sure about why RTM work incorrectly, try the Diagnosis tool to find out.<br />

 <h3>◆ Smooth Style: </h3>
     Make a smooth terrain with a smaller sample.<br />
